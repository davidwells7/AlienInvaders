Controls:
Arrow Keys = Move
Z = Primary fire
X = Secondary fire

In this game your aim is to clear all 3 stages of aliens, and try to make a high score in the process.
You have two types of missile at your disposal, a standard missile and a power shot that penetrates
enemies, but has limited ammo.

The enemies missiles in this game home in on you, plus you don't get barriers like in the original.
However, special attacks and an invincibility power-up help to keep it balanced, yet give a different
experience to the original Space Invaders

Tips:

Fill your Power bar in order to become temporarily invincible. Time your last shot, as the effect is immediate!

There are three types of aliens in the game. The big green ones take a lot of hits, but are not vital to clearing
the level. Kill them if you want to aim for a high score!


The music in this game is from the SNES game Star Fox, copyrighted by Nintendo. The sound effects are free sounds
found online. All sprites excluding the background were made by me.
